# Artificial Neural Networks

In this repository, you can find related documents and my solutions of assignments about Prof. Dr. Ethem Alpaydin's Artificial Neural Networks course at Bogazici University. 

I would like to thank Burak Suyunu (@suyunu) for all help in this assignments.

### Assignment-I: Parametric Classification
* Estimate class priors, means and variances using the training data.
* Plot *training data*, estimated likelihoods and posteriors together on the same plot. Use different symbols for different classes. 
* Use your estimated discriminants to classify the test data and report the confusion matrix on the *test data*.

### Assignment-II: Linear Regression
* Inputs are 16x16 binary images and there are 10 classes. 
* You will implement linear logistic regression. 
* Show how training and test misclassifications change as training proceeds and report the final confusion matrices on training and test data.
